## The controller

You don't need to touch it — but the controller in `src/_controller/` is plain,
readable source. Open it any time to see how the pieces fit together, or tweak it
to change how the framework behaves. Nothing here is a black box.

## Feedback

This SDK is built to be read. If something's unclear or could be better, open an
issue — feedback is welcome.
